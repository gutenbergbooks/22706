    <p>
      Mr. Joseph Kilgore was suffering from one of those spring influenzas which
      make a man feel as if he were his own grandfather. His nose had acquired
      the shape of a turnip and the complexion of a beet. All his bones ached as
      if he had been soundly thrashed, and his eyes were weak and watery. Your
      deadly disease is oftener than not a gentleman who takes your life without
      mauling you, but the minor diseases are mere bruisers who just go in for
      making one as uncomfortable and unpresentable as possible. Mr. Kilgore's
      influenza had been coming on for several days, and when he woke up this
      particular morning and heard the rain dripping on the piazza-roof just
      under his bedroom-window, he concluded, like a sensible man, that he would
      stay at home and nurse himself over the fire that day, instead of going to
      the office. So he turned over and snoozed for an hour or two, luxuriating
      in a sense of aches and pains just pronounced enough to make the warmth
      and softness of the bed delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward noon, the edge of this enjoyment becoming dulled, he got up,
      dressed, and came downstairs to the parlor, where his brother's wife (he
      was a bachelor, living with a married brother) had considerately kindled
      up a coal-fire in the grate for his benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lying off in the rocking-chair till past dinner-time, he began to
      feel better and consequently restless. Concluding that he would like to
      read, he went rummaging about the bookcases for a likely-looking novel. At
      length he found in the upper shelf of a closet a book called "RÃ´les of a
      Detective," containing various thrilling accounts of crimes and the
      entanglement of criminals in the meshes of law and evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      One story in particular made a strong impression on his mind. It was a
      tale of circumstantial evidence, and about how it very nearly hung an
      innocent man for a murder which he had no thought of committing. It struck
      Joseph rather forcibly that this victim of circumstantial evidence was as
      respectable and inoffensive a person as himself, and probably had never
      any more thought of being in danger from the law. Circumstances had set
      their trap for him while he was quite unconscious of peril, and he only
      awoke to find himself in the toils. And from this he went on to reflect
      upon the horrible but unquestionable fact that every year a certain
      proportion, and perhaps a very considerable proportion, of those who
      suffered the penalties of the law, and even the death-penalty, are
      innocent men,&mdash;victims of false or mistaken evidence. No man, however
      wise or virtuous, can be sure that he will not be taken in this fearful
      conscription of victims to the blind deity of justice. "None can tell,"
      thought Joseph, with a shudder, "that the word he is saying, the road he
      is turning, the appointment he is making, or whatever other innocent act
      he is now engaged in, may not prove the last mesh in some self-woven
      death-net, the closing link in some damning chain of evidence whose
      devilish subtlety shall half convince him that he must be guilty as it
      wholly convinces others."
    </p>
    <p>
      Timidity is generally associated with imaginativeness, if not its result,
      and Joseph, although he concealed the fact pretty well under the mask of
      reticence, was constitutionally very timid. He had an unprofitable habit
      of taking every incident of possible embarrassment or danger that occurred
      to his mind as the suggestion for imaginary situations of inconvenience or
      peril, which he would then work out, fancying how he would feel and what
      he would do, with the utmost elaboration, and often with really more
      nervous excitement than he would be likely to experience if the events
      supposed should really occur. So now, and all the more because he was a
      little out of sorts, the suggestions of this story began to take the form
      in his mind of an imaginary case of circumstantial evidence of which he
      was the victim. His fancy worked up the details of a fictitious case
      against himself, which he, although perfectly innocent, could meet with
      nothing more than his bare denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      He imagined the first beginnings of suspicion; he saw it filming the eyes
      of his acquaintances, then of his friends, and at last sicklying over the
      face even of his brother Silas. In fancy he made frantic attempts to
      regain the confidence of his friends, to break through the impalpable,
      impenetrable barrier which the first stir of suspicion had put between
      their minds and his. He cried, he begged, he pleaded. But in vain, all in
      vain. Suspicion had made his appeals and adjurations sound even to his
      friends as strange and meaningless as the Babel-builders' words of a
      sudden became to each other. The yellow badge of suspicion once upon him,
      all men kept afar, as if he were a fever-ship in quarantine. No solitary
      imprisonment in a cell of stone could so utterly exclude him from the
      fellowship of men as the invisible walls of this dungeon of suspicion. And
      at last he saw himself giving up the hopeless struggle, yielding to his
      fate in dumb despair, only praying that the end might come speedily,
      perhaps even reduced to the abject-ness of confessing the crime he had not
      committed, in order that he might at least have the pity of men, since he
      could not regain their confidence. And so strongly had this vision taken
      hold on him that his breath came irregularly, and his forehead was damp as
      he drew his hand across it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As has been intimated, it was Mr. Joseph Kil-gore's very bad habit to
      waste his nervous tissue in the conscientiously minute elaboration of such
      painful imaginary situations as that above described, and in his present
      experience there was nothing particularly novel or extraordinary for him.
      It was the occurrence of a singular coincidence between this internal
      experience and a wholly independent course of actual events, which made
      that waking nightmare the beginning of a somewhat remarkable comedy, or,
      more properly, a tragedy, of errors. For, as Joseph lay back in his chair,
      in a state of nervous exhaustion and moral collapse, the parlor-door was
      thrown open, and Mrs. Silas Kilgore, his sister-in-law, burst into the
      room. She was quite pale, and her black eyes were fixed on Joseph's with
      the eager intensity, as if seeking moral support, noticeable in those who
      communicate startling news which they have not had time to digest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this apparition upon Joseph in his unstrung condition may be
      readily imagined. He sprang up, much paler than Mrs. Kilgore, his lips
      apart, and his eyes staring with the premonition of something shocking.
      These symptoms of extraordinary excitement even before she had spoken, and
      this air as if he had expected a shocking revelation, recurred to her mind
      later, in connection with other circumstances, but just now she was too
      full of her intelligence to dwell on anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man was murdered in our barn last night. They 've found the body!" she
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the meaning of her words broke on him, Joseph was filled with that sort
      of mental confusion which one experiences when the scene or circumstances
      of a dream recur in actual life. Was he still dreaming that ghostly vision
      of suspicion and the death-trap of circumstances? Was this a mere
      continuation of it? No, he was awake; his sister-in-law standing there,
      with pallid face and staring eyes, was not an apparition. The horrid,
      fatal reality which he had been imagining was actually upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not do it!" dropped from his ashen lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do it? Are you crazy? Who said anything about your doing it?" cried
      the astounded woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ring of genuine amazement in her voice was scarcely needed to recall
      Joseph to the practical bearing of his surroundings, and break the spell
      of superstitious dread. The sound of his own words had done it. With a
      powerful effort he regained something like self-control, and said, with a
      forced laugh:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an absurd thing for me to say! I don't know what I could have been
      thinking of. Very odd, was it not? But, dear me! a man murdered in our
      barn? You don't tell me! How terrible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His constrained, overdone manner was not calculated to abate Mrs.
      Kilgore's astonishment, and she continued to stare at him with an
      expression in which a vague terror began to appear. There are few shorter
      transitions than that from panic to anger. Seeing that her astonishment at
      his reception of the news increased rather than diminished, he became
      exasperated at the intolerable position in which he was placed. His face,
      before so pale, flushed with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damnation! What are you staring at me that way for?" he cried fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kilgore gave a little cry, half of indignation, half of fright, and
      went out of the room, shutting the door after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph had ample opportunity to review the situation before he was again
      disturbed, which, indeed, was not till some hours later, at dusk, when
      Silas came home, and the tea-table was set. Silas had been promptly
      summoned from his shop when the discovery of the body was made, and had
      been busy all the afternoon with the police, the coroner, and the crowds
      of visitors to the scene of the tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation at the tea-table ran entirely upon the various incidents
      of the discovery, the inquest, and the measures of the police for the
      apprehension of the criminal. Mrs. Kilgore was so full of questions that
      she scarcely gave Silas time to answer, and Joseph flattered himself that
      his comparative silence was not noticeable. Nevertheless, as they rose
      from the table, Silas remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't seem much interested in our murder, Joseph; you have n't asked
      the first question about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kilgore was just leaving the room, and she turned her head to see how
      he would answer. But he, too, turned off the matter by saying something
      about Maria's loquaciousness having left him no chance. After tea the
      little family circle was gathered in the parlor. Mrs. Kilgore was sewing;
      Silas read the newspaper, and Joseph sat up by the fire. From time to
      time, as he glanced around, he caught Mrs. Kilgore's eyes studying him
      very intently. Her manner indicated that her indignation at his behavior
      and language earlier in the afternoon had been quite neutralized by her
      curiosity as to its cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's nothing in the paper to-night but the murder, and I know that
      already," exclaimed Silas, finally. "Maria, where's there something to
      read? Hullo! what's this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken up from the table the story of circumstantial evidence which
      Joseph had been reading that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Maria, here's that murder-book you wouldn't let me finish last
      summer for fear I'd murder you some night. Who on earth hunted up that
      book of all books, to-day of all days?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did," replied Joseph, clearing his throat, in order to speak with a
      natural inflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did?" exclaimed Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have looked the house over to find it, for I hid it carefully,"
      said Mrs. Kilgore, looking sharply at him. "What made you so anxious to
      get it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not particularly anxious. I was merely looking for something to
      read," said Joseph, making a pretense of yawning, as if the matter was a
      very trivial one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose the murder brought it to his mind," said Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no!" exclaimed Mrs. Kilgore quickly. "You must have been reading it
      before the murder. Now that I remember, I saw it in your hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before the murder, were you, Joseph? Why, that's almost enough to make
      one feel superstitious," said Silas, turning around in his chair, so as to
      look fairly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph had half a mind to make a clean breast of the matter then and
      there, and explain to them how curiously the reading of that book had
      affected him. But he reflected that Silas was rather unimaginative, and
      would probably be more mystified than enlightened by his explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do believe it was reading that book which made you act so queerly when
      I brought you in the news of the murder," pursued Mrs. Kilgore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is that? How did he act queerly?" asked Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not aware that I acted queerly at all," said Joseph doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew well enough he had acted queerly, and did not mean to deny that;
      but, as children and confused persons often do, he answered to the
      underlying motive rather than the language. He only thought of denying the
      inference of suspicion that her words seemed to him to suggest. But to
      Mrs. Kilgore he very naturally seemed to be prevaricating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Joseph!" said she, in a raised voice, and with a slight asperity;
      "you know how you jumped up, looking like a ghost, the moment I opened the
      door, and the first thing you said after I 'd told you that they 'd found
      a murdered man in the barn, was&mdash;Why, Joseph, what's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must go back a little. When the conversation turned on the book and
      Joseph's connection with it, a minute or so previous, Silas had quite
      naturally glanced over at his brother, and, as the talk went on, his
      glance had become a somewhat concentrated gaze, although expressive of
      nothing but the curiosity and slight wonder which the circumstances
      suggested. It would not do to have Silas think that he avoided his eyes,
      and so Joseph had, as soon as he felt this gaze, turned his own face
      rather sharply toward it. He had meant merely to meet his brother's look
      in a natural and unaffected manner. But, although never more sensible of
      just what such a manner would be, he was utterly unable to compass it. He
      was perfectly aware that the expression of his eyes was much too serious
      and challenging,&mdash;and yet he could not, for the soul of him, modify
      it. Nor did he dare to withdraw his gaze after it had once met his
      brother's, although knowing that it was fast becoming a fierce stare, and
      perceiving that Silas had already noticed something peculiar in it. For to
      drop his eyes would be utter discomfiture and rout. As Mrs. Kilgore
      alluded to his queer demeanor when she told him the news, his face began
      to flush with the anticipation of the revelation that was coming at this
      most unfavorable moment, even while his eyes were locked with the already
      startled ones of Silas. As she went on, the flush covered the lower part
      of his face, and rose like a spring-tide up his cheeks, and lent a fierce,
      congested glare to his eyes. He felt how woeful and irretrievable a thing
      it would be for him just then to lose his countenance, and at the thought
      the flush burned deeper and merged higher. It overspread his high, bald,
      intellectual forehead, and incarnadined his sconce up to the very top of
      it. At this moment it was that Mrs. Kilgore broke off her narrative with
      the exclamation, "Why, Joseph, what's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At her words it seemed as if every drop of blood in his body poured into
      his face. He could endure it no longer. He rose abruptly, strode out of
      the parlor, and went to his room, although it was but eight o'clock, and
      he had no fire there. If he had staid another moment he must have brained
      Silas and his wife with the poker, such an ungovernable anger boiled up in
      him with the sense of his causeless, shameful discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Joseph left the parlor the eyes of Silas and his wife met each other,
      &mdash;his dull with bewilderment and terror at a spectral fear; hers keen
      with a definite suspicion. But even her loquacity was subdued by a real
      fright. She had nothing to say. Her sensation was like that of one who,
      hunting a hare, stumbles upon a wolf. She had been both offended and made
      curious by Joseph's demeanor that afternoon, but the horrid idea that
      within a moment had been suggested to both their minds had so little
      occurred to her as a serious possibility that she was even on the point of
      rallying Joseph on it before her husband. Some time after he had left the
      parlor Silas asked, with averted face:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it that he said when you told him the news?" and then she
      repeated his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Joseph, sitting wild-eyed upon his bed in the darkness in the room
      above, red no longer, but pale as death, heard the murmur of the voices,
      and knew that she was telling him. No one of the household slept much that
      night, except Mrs. Kil-gore. Whenever she awoke she heard her husband
      tossing restlessly, but she dared not ask him what was the matter. In vain
      did Silas rehearse to himself all through the night-hours how petty were
      the trifles in Joseph's demeanor which had disturbed him. They were of the
      sort of trifles which create that species of certainty known as moral
      certainty,&mdash;the strongest of all in the mind it occupies, although so
      incapable of being communicated to others. It mattered little how much
      evidence there was, if it sufficed to lodge the faintest trace of
      suspicion in his mind. For, like some poisons, an atom of suspicion is as
      fatal as the largest quantity, Nay, perhaps, even more surely so, for
      against great suspicion the mind often takes arms and makes valiant head;
      but a little doubt, by its timid and hesitant demeanor, disarms
      opposition, and is readily entertained. And all that night, lying awake,
      and knowing that Silas was sleepless just the other side of the partition,
      and that the fungus of suspicion was moment by moment overgrowing his
      mind, he could hardly wait for morning, but would fain have rushed, even
      now in the darkness, to his bedside to cry: "I did not do it! Believe me,
      brother, I did not do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, however, the sun shone brightly into his room, and last
      night's events and misunderstandings seemed like a bad dream. He went
      downstairs almost cheery. He did not find Silas, but Mrs. Kilgore was
      about. He was rather startled to observe the entire change in her
      demeanor. Yesterday she was constantly following him up with her sharp
      black eyes and brisk questions and exclamations, but now she seemed
      frightened, acted in a constrained manner, and avoided his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Silas?" he asked, as they sat down to table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said that there was something he must see to at the shop before work
      began, so he had an early breakfast," replied Mrs. Kilgore, with her eyes
      on her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she been looking up, she would have seen a piteous constriction in the
      muscles of Joseph's face. His heart was sick, and all his regained courage
      sank away. It was no bad dream. Silas was afraid to meet him. He left his
      meal untasted, and went to the office. A dozen acquaintances stopped him
      on his way down-street to ask about the murder; and all day long somebody
      was dropping in to pester him on the same subject. He told them with a
      dull, abstracted air all the fresh details he knew, but felt all the time
      as if he cheated each auditor of the vital part of the matter, in that he
      failed to shout after him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silas suspects me of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Silas had, indeed, left the house early for the purpose of avoiding his
      brother. He was in a condition of mind and nerve in which he did not dare
      to meet him. At tea the brothers met for the first time since the night
      previous. There was a constraint between them like that between strangers,
      but stronger and more chilling far than ever that is. There is no chill
      like that which comes between friends, and the nearer the friends the more
      deathly the cold. Silas made a little effort to speak of business-matters,
      but could not keep it up, and soon a silence settled over the party, only
      broken by the words of table-service. Mrs. Kilgore sat pale and frightened
      all through the meal without venturing a single phrase, and scarcely
      looking up from her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was of that kind which all felt to be more expressive than the
      loudest, most explicit language could be,&mdash;more merciless than any
      form of verbal accusation. Such silence is a terribly perfect medium, in
      which souls are compelled to touch each other, resent as they may the
      contact. Several times Joseph was on the point of rising and rushing from
      the table. How many more such meals could he stand or could they stand?
      All of them recognized that the situation had become perceptibly more
      serious and more pronounced on account of that silent tea-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in particular not the slightest allusion made by any one to the
      murder, which, seeing that it had happened but yesterday, and would
      naturally still have been an engrossing topic, was an omission so pointed
      as to be an open charge of guilt. There is such a thing as emphasizing a
      topic by suppressing it, as letters are sunk into stone. The omission
      impressed Silas as it did Joseph, but, regarding it from his point of
      view, it did not occur to him but that Joseph was the one solely
      responsible for it. He, Silas, had refrained from reference to it because
      his suspicions in regard to Joseph made the topic unendurable. But he
      could not imagine that Joseph could have had any other motive for his
      silence on the subject but a guilty conscience,&mdash;some secret
      knowledge of the crime. Thus regarded, it was a terrible confirmation.
      That a perception that he was suspected might cause an innocent man to act
      very much as if he were conscious of guilt did not occur to Silas, as,
      perhaps, it would have failed to occur to most persons in just his
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaving the tea-table the brothers went together into the parlor,
      according to the family custom. They took their accustomed seats on
      opposite sides of the fireplace, but there was no conversation. A veil was
      between them. Both were thinking of the same thing,&mdash;thinking of it
      intensely,&mdash;and each knew that the other was thinking of it, and yet
      neither for worlds could have commanded the courage to speak of it. The
      suspicion had grown definite in Silas's mind, and yet, whenever he brought
      himself to the point of putting it in words, it suddenly seemed
      impossible, cruel, and absurd. But if Silas found it impossible to speak,
      far more so it seemed to Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      To charge another with suspecting us is half to confess ourselves worthy
      of suspicion. It is demoralizing,&mdash;it is to abandon the pride of
      conscious rectitude. To deny an accusation is to concede to it a
      possibility, a color of reason; and Joseph shrank with unutterable
      repugnance from that. He felt that he could be torn limb from limb sooner
      than betray by a word that he recognized the existence of suspicion so
      abominable. Besides, of what avail would be a denial without evidence to
      disprove a suspicion which had arisen without evidence? It was a thing too
      impalpable to contend with. As well fight a fog as seek to destroy by mere
      denial suspicion so vague, unsubstantial, and subtile, as that which
      enveloped him. Silas would, of course, eagerly accept his denial; he well
      knew how he would spring to his side, how warm and firm would be his
      hand-clasp, and how great, perhaps, his momentary relief. But he was,
      after all, but human, and no man can control his doubts. Silas would still
      be unable, when he thought the matter over, to help the feeling that there
      was, after all, something very strange about his conduct from first to
      last. It is the subtiler nature of doubt to penetrate the heart more
      profoundly than confidence, and to underlie it. No generous St. George of
      faith can reach the nether den where it lurks. Or, rather, is it like the
      ineradicable witch-grass which, though it be hewed off at the surface,
      still lives at the root, and springs forth luxuriantly again at the first
      favoring season?
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Joseph hoped that some circumstance, the detection of the
      murderer, or a healthier moral tone, might dissipate the cloud of
      suspicion between them, and then it would be far better not to have
      spoken, for, once put in words, the hateful thing would ever remain a
      mutual memory, never again to be denied, and which might come up to their
      minds whenever they looked each other in the eye thereafter. And so the
      brothers sat opposite each other in silence, their faces growing grayer as
      the clock ticked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The weather is growing cooler again," said Joseph, at last, rising to go
      to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at least two hours before his usual bedtime, but he could sit there
      no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think we shall have a frost," replied Silas, and the brothers
      parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Joseph had gone, Mrs. Kilgore came into the parlor and sat down with
      some sewing. She waited for her husband to speak and tell her if Joseph
      had said anything. But he sat there staring at the wall, and took no
      notice of her. Although she knew so well what had been preying upon his
      mind since last evening, yet he had not once referred to the matter, and
      she had not dared to do so. It was hard for a talkative little lady like
      her to understand this reticence about a matter so deeply felt. She could
      not comprehend that there may be griefs so ghastly that we dare not lift
      from them the veil of silence. She wanted to "talk it over" a little. She
      felt that would do Silas good, because she knew it would be a relief to
      her. Nor was she insensible to the gratification it would afford her
      vanity to discuss so serious a matter with her husband, whose general tone
      with her was one of jest and pleasantry, to the disparagement of her
      intellectual powers, as she thought. So, after glancing up several times
      timidly at Silas's still set profile, she said, in a weighty little voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think Joseph behaves very strangely about the murder?" Her
      words seemed to be several seconds in making an impression on Silas's
      mind, and then he slowly turned his face full upon her. It was a terrible
      look. The squared jaw, the drawn lips, the dull, distant stare, repulsed
      her as one might repulse a stranger intermeddling with a bitter private
      grief. Who was she, to come between him and his brother? He did not seem
      to think it worth while to say anything to explain so eloquent a glance,
      but immediately faced about again, as if dismissing the interruption from
      his mind. Mrs. Kilgore did not try to make any more conversation, but went
      to her bedroom and cried herself to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Silas sat in his chair in the parlor, and took no note of the hours
      till the lamp spluttered and went out. All through the evening, in
      Joseph's room, which was directly above, he had heard him walking to and
      fro, to and fro, sitting down awhile, and then starting again; and if the
      pacing had not finally come to an end, Silas could not have gone to bed,
      for his heart went out to his brother wrestling there alone with his
      dreadful secret, and he could not rest till he thought that he, too, was
      at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, for the very reason that Joseph was so dear to him, and he felt
      nothing could change that, he actually hesitated the less to admit these
      horrible suspicions. Love is impatient of uncertainly, and would rather
      presume the guilt of a friend from its longing to pour itself out in pity
      and tenderness, than restrain itself while judgment scrutinizes evidence
      and decides by a straw's weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A practical reflection, moreover, had occurred to Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Joseph had really&mdash;he did not dare to say to himself what&mdash;then
      it was of the utmost importance that they should quickly understand each
      other, so as to take steps to place him in safety. His desire to share
      Joseph's horrible secret was like the feeling with which one would fain
      uncover a friend's loathsome disease in order to help him. Before he went
      to sleep that night he resolved, therefore, that he would win his
      confidence by letting him see in every possible way, short of actual
      words, that he suspected the true state of things, and that Joseph might
      still confide in him as a faithful brother who would stand by him in the
      worst emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      On first meeting him the following morning he began to carry out this
      project so worthy of fraternal devotion. He sought occasion to shake hands
      with Joseph, and gave a meaning pressure to his clasp. At breakfast he was
      the only one who talked, and endeavored by his manner to let Joseph
      understand that he perfectly comprehended the situation, and was talking
      to cover his embarrassment and prevent Mrs. Kilgore from suspecting
      anything. Several times also he managed to catch his brother's eye, and
      give him a glance implying sympathy and mutual understanding. This
      demeanor added the last touch to Joseph's exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evading Silas's evident intention of walking down-street, he got away
      alone, and took both dinner and tea at a restaurant, to put off meeting
      his brother and sister-in-law as long as possible. He lingered long over
      his tea in the darkest, loneliest corner of the eating-house, for the
      prospect, no longer to be avoided, of returning home to confront his
      sister-in-law's frightened face and Silas's pathetic glances appeared
      intolerable. Wild ideas of flying from the city and returning never, or
      not until the truth about the murder had come to light, occurred to him.
      He even began to arrange what sort of a letter he should write to Silas.
      But men of forty, especially of Joseph's temperament, who have moved in
      the same business and domestic ruts all their lives, do not readily make
      up their minds to bold steps of this sort. To endure suffering or
      inconvenience is more natural than to change their settled habits. So it
      all ended in his going home at about eight o'clock, and being greatly
      relieved to find some callers there.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three of this strangely stricken family, indeed, shared that feeling.
      It was such a rest from the nervous strain whenever either or both were
      left alone with Joseph! The earnestness with which Mrs. Kilgore pressed
      her guests to stay a little longer was so unusual and apparently uncalled
      for that I fancy Mr. and Mrs. Smith had a vague suspicion that they were
      being made game of. But they would have been disabused of that impression
      could they have appreciated the sinking of heart with which their hosts
      heard the frontdoor close, and realized that they were again left to
      themselves. Only one thing had occurred to mar the relief which the call
      had afforded. The topic of the murder had been exhausted before Joseph
      entered, but, just as she was leaving, Mrs. Smith made a return to it,
      saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Kilgore, I was telling my husband I should think you must be scared
      to be in the house, for fear the murderer might still be hanging around."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kilgore shuddered, and cast an instantaneous, wholly involuntary
      glance at Joseph. Her husband intercepted it, and, catching his eye, she
      saw an expression in it as if he could strangle her for what was really
      only the fault of her nerves. She stammered something, and the bustle of
      the retiring guests covered her confusion well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Joseph, too, had caught that sudden, terrified glance of
      his sister-in-law's at him, and it affected him more than anything that
      had occurred in either of the two days since the murder. As the guests
      took their leave, his head dropped on his breast, and his arms fell by the
      sides of his chair. Mr. Kilgore wanted to send his wife from the room, but
      his voice stuck in his throat, his tongue refused to move. They waited a
      moment, and then Joseph said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send for the police! For God's sake, take me out of this! I can't stand
      it any longer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not yet nine o'clock, and a boy came by in the street crying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Extra! The Kilgore barn murderer captured! Full confession!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the words were perfectly audible through the lowered windows to
      all in the room, Mrs. Kilgore was the only one who took any mental
      cognizance of them. Nor did either of the men, who sat there like stones,
      take note of her as she left the room. A minute later they heard her
      scream, and she ran back with the open paper in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did not do it! He is crazy! They have found the murderer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Silas fixed an incredulous, questioning stare upon his wife, and then
      turned quickly toward his brother. As for Joseph, at first and for several
      moments, he gave no sign that he had heard at all. Then he slowly raised
      his eyes to his brother's face with a deliberate, cruel gaze of
      contemptuous sarcasm and cold aversion. The first effect of this great
      relief was to flood his mind with bitter wrath at those who had done him
      the great wrong from which, no thanks to them, he had been rescued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kilgore hastily read aloud, in a breathless voice, the newspaper
      account It seemed that two tramps had taken refuge in the barn from the
      storm that had raged the night of the murder, and getting into some
      quarrel before morning, one had stabbed the other and fled, only to be
      captured two days later and confess everything. When Mrs. Kilgore ceased
      reading, Joseph said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be a great disappointment for you that they are not going to hang
      me for it. I sincerely condole with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kilgore cried, "Oh, don't!" and Silas made a gesture of deprecation,
      but both felt that Joseph had a right to revile them as he chose, and they
      had no right to complain. But he, even while he could not deny himself the
      gratification of a little cruel reproach, knew that they were not to be
      blamed, that they had been as much the victims of a fatality as himself,
      and that this was one of those peculiarly exasperating wrongs which do not
      leave the sufferer even the satisfaction of being angry. Soon he got up
      and walked across the room, stretched himself, drew his hand over his
      forehead, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel as if I had just been dug up after being buried alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this sign of returning equanimity, Silas took courage and ventured to
      say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know we 've been a pair of crazy fools, Joe, but you 're a little to
      blame. What's made you act so queerly? You won't deny that you have acted
      so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph smiled,&mdash;one does n't appreciate the pure luxury of a smile
      until he has been deprived of it for a while,&mdash;lit a cigar, sat down
      with his legs over the arm of his arm-chair,&mdash;he had not indulged in
      an unconstrained posture for two days,&mdash;and told his side of the
      story. He explained how, thanks to that tale he was reading, and the
      ghastly reverie it suggested, his nerves were all on edge when Mrs.
      Kilgore burst in with a piece of news whose extraordinary coincidence with
      his train of thought had momentarily thrown him off his balance; and he
      tried to make them see that, after that first scene, all the rest was a
      logical sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kilgore, by virtue of her finer feminine nervous organization,
      understood him so readily that he saw he had made a mistake in not
      unbosoming himself to her at first. But Silas evidently did not so easily
      take his idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why did n't you just tell us that you had n't done it, and end the
      misunderstanding at one blow?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, don't you see," replied Joseph, "that to deny a thing before you are
      distinctly suspected of it is to suggest suspicion; while to deny it
      afterward, unless you have proof to offer, is useless?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What should we have come to but for the capture of the real murderer?"
      cried Mrs. Kilgore, with a shudder. cried Mrs. Kilgore, with a shudder.
